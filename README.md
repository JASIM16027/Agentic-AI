# ðŸ§© Agentic AI â€“ 30 Days Roadmap

### **Week 1: Foundations of Agentic AI**

ðŸ“Œ *Goal: Understand what agentic AI is, why it matters, and the ecosystem.*

* **Day 1:** Introduction to Agentic AI â€“ definition, evolution from LLMs to autonomous agents.
* **Day 2:** Study frameworks: LangChain, AutoGen, LlamaIndex, CrewAI â€“ compare features.
* **Day 3:** Learn about planning & reasoning in agents (ReAct, Chain-of-Thought, Tree-of-Thought).
* **Day 4:** Explore memory in agents â€“ short-term vs. long-term memory (vector DBs, Redis, Pinecone).
* **Day 5:** Tools and APIs â€“ connecting agents to external systems (browsers, databases, APIs).
* **Day 6:** Agents for workflows (task automation, orchestration with LangGraph or AutoGen).
* **Day 7:** Mini-project: Build a simple agent that fetches data from an API and summarizes it.

### **Week 2: Core Agentic Architectures**

ðŸ“Œ *Goal: Learn how agents make decisions, collaborate, and act in the real world.*

* **Day 8:** Study single-agent loop (perception â†’ reasoning â†’ action â†’ feedback).
* **Day 9:** Multi-agent systems â€“ communication protocols, negotiation, coordination.
* **Day 10:** Tools calling & function execution with OpenAI / Anthropic / local models.
* **Day 11:** Vector search & RAG for grounding agent knowledge.
* **Day 12:** Learn about Agent frameworks with memory (LangChainâ€™s AgentExecutor, AutoGen conversations).
* **Day 13:** Case study: research agents (AutoGPT, BabyAGI, HyperWrite).
* **Day 14:** Mini-project: Multi-agent team (researcher + writer) that generates an article.

### **Week 3: Specialized Agentic Use Cases**

ðŸ“Œ *Goal: Explore real-world applications and build functional prototypes.*

* **Day 15:** Agents for coding (Code Interpreter, SWE-agent, AI pair programming).
* **Day 16:** Agents for business workflows (report generation, CRM automation).
* **Day 17:** Agents for data (SQL + AI + dashboard).
* **Day 18:** Agents for personal productivity (email, calendar, notes automation).
* **Day 19:** Agents in customer support (chat + ticket automation).
* **Day 20:** Agents in research & knowledge management (AI librarians).
* **Day 21:** Mini-project: Build a **research assistant agent** that finds top news, summarizes, and emails you.

### **Week 4: Advanced & Deployment**

ðŸ“Œ *Goal: Build production-ready, secure, and scalable agent systems.*

* **Day 22:** Learn orchestration tools (LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen Studio).
* **Day 23:** Explore multi-agent simulations (economy, games, negotiation).
* **Day 24:** Study safety, alignment, and failure modes of agents.
* **Day 25:** Add long-term memory (vector DB + embeddings).
* **Day 26:** Add external tool use (search, email, Slack, databases).
* **Day 27:** Deploying agents (Docker + cloud + monitoring).
* **Day 28:** Test scalability â€“ running multiple agents in a system.
* **Day 29:** Final Project â€“ Build a multi-agent system for a **business use case** (e.g., market researcher + content creator + publisher).
* **Day 30:** Documentation, reflection, and sharing your agentic AI project portfolio.

---

âš¡ **End Goal:** By the end of 30 days, youâ€™ll have:

* 3â€“4 working **mini agent projects**.
* 1 full **end-to-end multi-agent system** deployed.
* Understanding of **LangChain, AutoGen, CrewAI, and vector databases**.
* A foundation to scale into enterprise-level agentic AI solutions.
